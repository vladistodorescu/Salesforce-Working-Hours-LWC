REQUIREMENTS

// We need to create a custom LWC component that allows the user to select working hours for each day of the week, similar to the "Google Working Hours" functionality. 
// The component will allow enabling/disabling days, selecting start and end times and will include validations: at least one active day must be set, ranges must be valid ("From" < "To"), and incomplete data cannot be saved.
// The user can either save the valid configuration or close the component without saving 
// — exiting in any other way should not be allowed.

// Upon saving, the component will record the information in a custom data model:
// - Working_Schedule__c (parent) — related to the current user who just used the component, containing general details such as timezone, status etc (of your choice).
// - Working_Day__c (child) — each record representing a day of the week, with fields: day, start time, end time and active/inactive.

// The component must be able to create a new program, subsequent editing is done directly from the platform.

// Build the component and everything related to it according to best practice.
// Don't forget about the test class with coverage >80%.

IMPLEMENTATION

// First we create a Global Value Set for the possible hour options

// Then we create the custom object Working_Schedule__c with the following fields:
//   - Active__c --> checkbox, set as active when record is created, and should be set to inactive when a new record has been created and assigned to the same user (visible, read-only)
//   - User_Lookup__c --> lookup relationship to User (which current User has this working schedule) (visible, read-only)
//   - Timezone__c --> a picklist for defining the Timezone in which the Working Schedule functions, with values from the Global Value Set "Timezones" (visible, read-only)

// Lastly, we create the custom object Working_Day__c with the following fields:
//   - Day_In_The_Week__c --> a picklist for defining which day of the week the program is for, with values from the Global Value Set "Day In The Week" (visible, read-only)
//   - Start_Hour__c --> a picklist for choosing the start hour of the working program from the day, with values from the Global Value Set "Hours in the Day" (visible, editable)
//   - End_Hour__c --> a picklist for choosing the end hour of the working program from the day, with values from the Global Value Set "Hours in the Day" (visible, editable)
//   - Active__c --> checkbox, set as active when record is created, and should be set to inactive when the master has been set to inactive (visible, read-only)
//   - Working_Schedule__c --> master-detail realtionship, where Working_Day__c is the detail, so we know to what weekly schedule the daily schedule belongs (visibile)

// Now that we have created the data model, we can start constructing the workingHours LWC.

// 1st Screen --> Welcome Screen
//   - here we explain to the user the LWC's functionality and allow him to start the process

// 2nd Screen --> Actual Scheduler
//   - we have an instruction set, which explains the user how to use the tool
//   - at the beginning, we are allowed to select for which working days we want to create the schedule (by selecting it, the html component appears, when deselected html component disappears and 
//     selected values are set to null, extra intervals removed)
//   - for each working day of the week we have 2 comboboxes with the options from the "Hours in the Day" Global Value Set (when pressing the "+" button the 2nd interval appears, when pressing     //     the "-" button it disappears, and values for it are set to null) 
//
// If "Cancel" button is pressed, the component is reset and no data is stored in the database.
// Now that we are able to take in data, we must validate and store it, following pattern is followed after pressing "Save" button:
//   - create a Working_Day__c record for each of the five working days, and a Working_Schedule__c record which will be parent for them
//   - iterate thorugh the workingIntervals map and assign the values (if exist) to the fields of the newly created records
//   - check if there is at least one valid first interval for one of the working days, so that the working schedule is not pointlessly inserted (if YES --> extract timezone from current running //     user and match it with the correct picklist value, from "Timezones" Global Value Set, assign to working schedule and insert it / if NO --> throw AuraHandledException)
//   - check if we have a valid first interval for the day (if not --> move onto the next day, and don't add to insert list)
//   - if we have a valid first interval for the day, check if we have values for the 2nd interval (if not --> add the Working_Day__c record to the insert list, with the one valid interval,               inserted Working_Schedule__c record ID as the parent for the master-detail relationship, and rest of the fields completed)
//   - if we do have values for the 2nd interval, check if it is a valid interval (if not --> throw AuraHandledException)
//   - if we have 2 valid intervals, check if they are senseful and don't overlap (if not --> throw AuraHandledException)
//   - if they are senseful anf don't overlap aswell, add the Working_Day__c record to the insert list, with the 2 valid intervals, inserted Working_Schedule__c record ID as the parent for the            master-detail relationship, and rest of the fields completed)
//   - after doing this for all working days, we check if the Working_Days__c record list is not empty, and if so we insert the records
