// REQUIREMENTS

// We need to create a custom LWC component that allows the user to select working hours for each day of the week, similar to the "Google Working Hours" functionality. 
// The component will allow enabling/disabling days, selecting start and end times and will include validations: at least one active day must be set, ranges must be valid ("From" < "To"), and incomplete data cannot be saved.
// The user can either save the valid configuration or close the component without saving 
// — exiting in any other way should not be allowed.

// Upon saving, the component will record the information in a custom data model:
// - Working_Schedule__c (parent) — related to the current user who just used the component, containing general details such as timezone, status etc (of your choice).
// - Working_Day__c (child) — each record representing a day of the week, with fields: day, start time, end time and active/inactive.

// The component must be able to create a new program, subsequent editing is done directly from the platform.

// Build the component and everything related to it according to best practice.
// Don't forget about the test class with coverage >80%.
